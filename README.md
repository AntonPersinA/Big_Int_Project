# Big_Int_Project
It's project, that realised work with big int number.

In this thread https://github.com/AntonPersinA/Big_Int_Project/tree/big_int you can see a project that is in the editing stage and which I use to add features that may not work at the moment. 

This thread https://github.com/AntonPersinA/Big_Int_Project/tree/test contains a project where you can run tests on the original big_numbers library and it will also be in working order
